# Remember some tricks on Pacman

## install a package
```sh
$ sudo pacman -S <my_package_name>
```

## when there is a problem such as 'target not found' when trying to install a package, (e.g. Vagrant with $ sudo pacman -S vagrant), update the system with the following command
```sh
$ sudo pacman -Syu
```
